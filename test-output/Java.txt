1. What is a Method ?
Method is a action or function used to perform a certain  task to get the
expected results.
For example:
ringing, calling ,send data, received data these are the actions/functions of mobile phone 
and we can write this function using a method in java..
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. How to declare Method?
To declare a method,we need to follow the syntax..

2.1 Syntax:
access-modifier  return-type  method-name (param-list)
{
   //code;
}

2.2 Access_modifiers:
access - modifier controls the access level/ scope of method..
Access - modifier  is also called as access-specifier..
We can use four types of access-modifiers for method in Java..
Public,Private,Protected,
 and Default..

2.3 Return_Type:
return_type specifies what type of value a method will returns.

For example:
If you order a pizza..
then you will get pizza as a return.. 
food  orderPizza()
{
   return pizza;
}
return statement is used to return any value or data..
So here, method has food return type
Because this method is returning a pizza and pizza is type of food..
Similarly,
If method has an int return type then method returns an integer value.
If method has void returnType then method won't return any value..

2.4 method_name:
A method name should typically represent what its task is.

2.5 Parameters/ Arguments:
Sometimes we have to pass  data to the method to perform certain task / operation on that data and that data  is called parameters or also called as arguments..
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.How to call a method?
To get the expected result, we need to execute the method and to execute the method we need to call a method..

3.1 How to call static method? static method is belong to a class i.e static method work for a class..
To call a static method in Java, write the methodâ€™s name followed by   two parentheses()and a semicolon(;)
For example,
addNumbers();
	
Or you can call static method  using a class name..
For example:
Test.addNumbers();
here, Test is class name and addNumbers () is static method's name.

3.2 How to call non- static method?
non- static method is belong to an object of a class 
That means, non-static method work for an object and that's why,
to call a non-static method first you need to create an object then using that object you can call non-static method..

For example:
// Creating an object
Test obj = new Test();  (class refof obj = new classname)
// Calling non-static method using an object
obj.addNumbers();
So here, obj is an object name..
